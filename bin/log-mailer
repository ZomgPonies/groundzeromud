The following is a MIME attachment of an archived file containing
the logs for the previous day up to 6:10am on this day.  There will
be, at the least, a directory named MMDDYYYY, where MM is the month,
DD is the day, and YYYY is the year (e.g., 02172001 for 17 Feb 2001).
You may also find a players/ directory, which are the complete logs
for individual players.  You should let players/*.log files be
overwritten, since it always sends the complete file again and you
will only be storing duplicate information by doing it any other
way.

The game log files are usually named XXXX.log, where XXXX is some
number starting at 1000 and going up to 9999.  Each XXXX.log file
corresponds to a single boot.  Since I don't do log maintainence
every day, you'll often see that the number of the log file picks
up on one day where the last day left off.  This is because I have
not yet checked, archived, and removed the logs from the previous
day.
